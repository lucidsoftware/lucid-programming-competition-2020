# Antimatter Annihilation

## Description
When antimatter comes in contact with regular matter, they annihilate eachother and release a burst of radiation.
This can cause lots of problems if it happens in the wrong place or at the wrong time.
In order to prevent any accidents, we need you remove all of the antimatter from the universe.
Lucily for you, String Theory allows us to model and mutate the entire universe as a single string.

## Problem Statement
Given a string representing the universe, remove all instances of the substring `antimatter`, including instances that appear only after removing other `antimatter`.

## Input Format
The input consists of a single string of space characters lowercase letters (` ` and `a-z`).

## Constraints
<!-- Not sure what's feasible yet. Still working on the solutions. -->

## Output Fomat
Output a single string, what remains of the input after removing all of the antimatter.
