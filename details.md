# Competition Details

## Problems:

There are 11 problems focusing on reasoning and algorithmic problem solving. Each problem defines the following:

-   A description
-   Input & output formats (with samples)
-   Known test cases. Solutions can be run and re-run against these known test cases without any penalties.
-   Unknown test cases. Solutions will be graded based on these test cases upon submission.

The problems will be available at [https://www.hackerrank.com/lpc-2019](https://www.hackerrank.com/lpc-2019). At the start of the competition, you will also receive a paper copy of the problems. It is ok to write on these paper copies.

Please note: although the 11 problems range in difficulty from easy to hard, they will be ordered _randomly_, not based on difficulty.

Input is given on stdin, and output is expected on stdout. See [https://www.hackerrank.com/environment/sample-problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment/sample-problem) for examples in various languages. Input from the test cases may or may not end with a trailing new line. Extra whitespace is ignored in output. Sometimes a certain numerical accuracy is required of output; in these cases you may print the answer with any number of digits, as long as the printed number is accurate to at least the required number of decimal places.

## Submissions:

Submissions must be made through HackerRank. Before submitting, it is recommended that you run your code against the known test cases. HackerRank shows you stdout and stderr when running against the known test cases.

A submission consists of your source code, in one file, limited to 50kb. For details on compilers, runtimes, and time and memory limits, see [https://www.hackerrank.com/environment](https://www.hackerrank.com/environment). The time and memory limits are the same for all problems. Solutions will time out and fail if not completed within the time limit. Algorithms may need to be optimized if submissions are timing out.

## Questions on Problems:

Requests for clarification may be submitted to `lucidsoftware` via [https://www.hackerrank.com/inbox](https://www.hackerrank.com/inbox). Each problem has been carefully reviewed for clarity and correctness, so it is unlikely that any further information will be given. If ambiguity or error is discovered, all contestants will be notified at [https://www.hackerrank.com/notifications](https://www.hackerrank.com/notifications).

## Scoring:

Scoring is done ACM ICPC-style. (see https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/rules):

-   Score is the number of problems correctly solved.
-   In the case of a tie, the winner will be determined by the lowest cumulative time to solve each problem. (Note: A 20-minute penalty will be added for each incorrect submission on problems that were eventually solved.)

## Leaderboard:

The leaderboard is available at [https://contest.golucid.co/](https://contest.golucid.co/). We will intentionally stop updating the leaderboard one hour before the end of the competition.

## Prizes:

The top 3 teams at each location will take home Amazon gift cards! Hereâ€™s how it breaks down:

-   At each location
    -   1st place team: \$200 per team member
    -   2nd place team: \$100 per team member
    -   3rd place team: \$50 per team member
-   Overall winner across all universities: an additional \$100 per team member
